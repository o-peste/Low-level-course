# Low-level-course
  This course is meant to be a "community course" -> I'll make classes about low level computation and try to explain complex concepts in a easy way, and by the end of the course, we'll make a simple microkernel, but functional. I love to learn so I'll do my best to make those classes (everything in this course has a book behind it). Any errors, use the git to correct, I'll be glad. It'll be in portuguese, this explaning is for the understanding of anyone who wants to colaborate (translation too)
